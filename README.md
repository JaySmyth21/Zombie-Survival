# Zombie-Survival
Zombie survival is a student project game developed in three months as part of our COMP 245 course.
You play as a courier delivering a cure to a remote island in a zombie apocalypse
Your goal is to traverse the once bustling city to reach a speed boat while avoiding zombies and human scavengers
You can find health, gun, Ammo and food pickups on the various streets and rooftops of the city
you only have a limited amount of time before the driver leaves so plan your route wisely.
